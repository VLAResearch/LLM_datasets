These bacteria live on the skin and in the nose and mouth, and they generally don't cause any problems. However, if there's a break in the skin, such as a cut, scrape, or insect bite, these bacteria can enter and cause an infection.

This fluid build-up can lead to changes in the skin and tissues, making them more vulnerable to injury and infection.\n\nSince cellulitis is caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin, those with lymphedema are at a higher risk of developing the infection. Furthermore, having cellulitis can damage the lymphatic system and worsen lymphedema symptoms.\n\nTherefore, it's crucial for individuals with lymphedema to take extra care to protect their skin from injuries, promptly treat any wounds, and manage their condition properly to reduce the risk of cellulitis.",

    "response": "The immune system plays a crucial role in controlling cutaneous leishmaniasis. Once Leishmania parasites enter the body, they're engulfed by immune cells called macrophages. A strong immune response can help contain the infection and limit disease progression. However, the parasites can survive within the macrophages and evade the immune response, leading to disease. Therefore, the outcome of infection largely depends on the individual's immune response to the parasite.",

    "response": "The wound healing process involves several stages:\n\n1. Hemostasis: This is the first stage that occurs immediately after the injury where the body works to stop the bleeding through clot formation.\n\n2.

You may notice the wound becoming red and swollen, and it might feel warm and painful.\n\n3. Proliferative Phase: This phase involves the growth of new tissue to replace the damaged one. You'll see the wound starting to fill in with new skin and the edges of the wound pulling together. This phase can last several weeks.\n\n4. Maturation Phase: The final phase is the 'remodeling' phase where the new tissue strengthens and gains flexibility.
